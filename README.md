My name is Ilona (Lona) van der Linden (pronouns she/her/hers). I'm a San Diego native completing my graduate studies in Computer Science at Santa Clara University. I received my bachelors of Computer Science from the University of Wyoming. I love pilates, making good coffee, cooking, and collecting vinyls.

My GitHub is a little bare - that's because much of my work is hosted elsewhere on the interwebs.
